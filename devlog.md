DEVLOG FOR CS4337 PROJECT 2 - ZANE SMITH (zps230000)

(5:46 PM 5/10) Pre-Session Thoughts: I'm still fresh in terms of my prolog experience, so I will have to plan out how I want to go about certain pathfinding / maze logic via a declarative language rather than an imperative one.
Prolog works like a big library of statements, so I'd ideally need a way of creating some predicates the evaluate steps and valid moves. For now I'm going to bed...
